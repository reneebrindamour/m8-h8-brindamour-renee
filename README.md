I found this to be another fun and challenging assignment. I have been using transitions throughout this class, but didn't have experience with animations. 

After reviewing the reading material and lectures, I still felt like I needed to explore animations independently before I was ready to code them. 

Therefore, I sought out videos online. My employer offers me free service to LinkedIn Learning and I watched videos on YouTube. 

After watching a few videos, I was ready to go. I waited a day before I coded my files to make sure that I had actually learned it, sat down and coded it. 

It was a fun experience and I feel like I have the concept down well. I'm sure with time and practice there is so much more to learn. But, this assignment was a good start.
